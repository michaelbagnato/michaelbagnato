## Nice to meet you, I'm Michael!

I live in Melbourne, Australia where I've been a software developer for over 
ten years.

Whilst my main focus has been backend development using .NET Core, I'm 
comfortable working across the full stack using TypeScript and React on the
frontend.  

I love working with cloud technologies (I'm an AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner)
and also have experience with Docker, DevOps and test automation.
